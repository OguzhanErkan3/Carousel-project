# ðŸš€ How to Run the Project Locally

To properly view and interact with the carousel (especially since it loads product data via `fetch()`), you **must** run it using a local web server. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OguzhanErkan3/Carousel-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Carousel-project
   ```

3. Start a local server (using http-server if Node.js is installed):
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

   > If `http-server` is not installed, you can install it globally:
   > ```bash
   > npm install -g http-server
   > ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```
